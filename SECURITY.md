# vak Security

This document discusses vak project security, basic security concepts related to using untrusted code and parameters, suggested coding practices, and guidelines for reporting a vulnerability.

## Programs and data

Programs or code that can be executed may read and write files, send and receive data over the network, and/or spawn additional processes. Though this is useful and desirable, allowing these capabilities to run unchecked can open the door to unwanted behavior and potential security concerns.

## Running untrusted code

As a general rule: **Always** execute untrusted code inside a sandbox (e.g.,
[nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)). The vak project cannot guarantee that project code is free of all errors or that a code dependency, such as a library, is free of errors or potential vulnerabilities.  

## Accepting untrusted inputs

Passing invalid combinations of parameters can allow potentially insecure behavior.
This behavior wonâ€™t always translate into actual vulnerabilities.  This would be similar to directly dereferencing a null pointer in a C++ program: not a vulnerability by itself but any coding error that could cause a program to crash could allow a buffer overflow, or a memory dump that could leak information, or an opportunity to install malware.

It is possible, but not necessarily easy to write code that can securely process untrusted inputs. However, since bugs can generally be found in any complex software, then letting users control the inputs could allow them to trigger bugs. So, it is generally a good practice to isolate parts of a system exposed to untrusted (e.g., user-provided) inputs in a sandbox. Even if the code is secure, the Python interpreter or a Python library could have a bug, so a sandbox is recommended.

## Suggested coding practices

Code should include logic or exception handlers to safely deal with conditions that can trigger side effects or incorrect behavior in order to avoid a bug which could result in a potential vulnerability. Conditions which warrant special attention would include accepting and processing user input or missing resources like files being read or written and insufficient memory. Information regarding failures should be logged to help track their occurrence and to help debug and avoid them.

In addition to outright failures, code could monopolize resources on a shared host system and cause a system slowdown which could result in an unintentional but nevertheless undesirable denial of service from the perspective of other system users. When running code on a shared system, execution should be monitored and programs should practice proper hygiene by releasing resources and exiting cleanly. 

## Reporting potential vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are bugs that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, to steal data, or to disrupt operations. Bugs, which are reported separately, are errors that can cause a program to crash, produce incorrect output, or execute in an unexpected way. 

Please submit a vulnerability report for bugs that can result in an exploitation. The report should explain how a bug could be exploited to multiply its impact, its potential target, and the impact of the exploit. Please contact us through our blog to submit a vulnerability report. When reporting a potential vulnerability, please give it a descriptive title and please include the following information:

*   Your name and organization / affiliation (if any). You may submit a report as "anonymous" If that is your preference. 
*   The approximate date when the issue was discovered.
*   A step-by-step description of how the bug / vulnerability can be triggered and also the execution state and end state of the code when the bug is exploited. This will help us understand how to replicate the bug and how we might be able to defend against it.
*   A description, in your words, of who might exploit the vulnerability, and the negative impact that could result. 
*   Whether this vulnerability is already public and if it has been assigned a tracking number in a separate vulnerability tracking system. 

After receiving a vulnerability report, we will attempt to replicate the problem, assess the degree of impact, and depending on the outcome of our findings, add a work item to our queue for completing a fix.
